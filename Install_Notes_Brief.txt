# Brief install notes. More readable. This sets up the Flow conda environment and Sumo installation to our local PC.
# Could turn into a dockerfile later?

# SuMO installation:
sudo apt-get install sumo sumo-tools sumo-doc

# Flow environment installation:

git clone https://github.com/flow-project/flow.git

(if you start from our project, you can use: https://github.com/jrwplm10/RL_Project_Group_8.git)

# In the repository.
conda env create -f environment_repaired.yml
conda activate flow
python setup.py develop

# NOTE: TO run any scripts, you must export this as the SUMO_HOME variable:
export SUMO_HOME=/usr/bin

# Additional requirements, as of 11/22/24: (Do these steps in the (flow) environment)

# Additional dependencies:
pip install stable-baselines

# Downgrade protobuf in (flow) environment:
pip install protobuf==3.20.*

# Additional dependency: h-baselines:
# Clone this somewhere (doesn't matter where; be chaotic if you want):
git clone git@github.com:AboudyKreidieh/h-baselines.git

# From the (flow) environment, install this cloned repository using git:
cd h-baselines/  # Where ever you put it.
pip install -e . # Installs this git repository into your conda environment.

# NOTE: Expect some bugs/broken dependencies. This codebase is old & not super stable...

# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Running experiments ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ #

# Looks like the scripts in exp_configs set up and run various experiments.

# To run the bottle0 benchmark (in /exp_configs/rl/singleagent/bottleneck0_benchmark.py), do the following:

# DO THIS:
python train.py bottleneck0_benchmark

# NOT THIS:
python train.py ./exp_configs/rl/singleagent/bottleneck0_benchmark.py

# I think (hope) it will work for the other exp_configs files...
